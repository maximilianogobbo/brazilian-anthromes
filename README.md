## Description

This repository includes R Markdown scripts and documents (`.Rmd`) associated with the Doctoral Thesis "REGIONALIZATION OF BRAZILIAN ANTHROMES: Tool for Mapping in the R® Language". The projects available here involve the capture, analysis, mining, treatment, manipulation, plotting and mapping of demographic and land use and cover data.

The data used in this research were produced by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), to which we are immensely grateful for making this wide range of information available.
