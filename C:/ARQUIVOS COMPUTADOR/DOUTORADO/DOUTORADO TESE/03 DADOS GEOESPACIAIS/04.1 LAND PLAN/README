# Brazilian Anthromes Map

## Description

This directory is related to the construction of the mapping of São Paulo's anthromes, based on data produced by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). In this code, we combine demographic data sets with land use and land cover data, generating the mapping of anthromes in the State of São Paulo.## Requirements

To run the scripts from this repository, you will need to have the following software installed:

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

Additionally, you will need to install some R packages. The main packages used are:

library(sf)      
library(terra)   
library(dplyr)   
library(spData)
library(raster)
library(ows4R)
library(osmdata)
library(geodata)
library(tigris)
library(tidycensus)
library(GSODR)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2,gapminder, magrittr)
library(pander)
library(rgdal)
library(leaflet)
library(rmapshaper)
library(mapview)
library(tmap)
library(osmdata)
library(ggmap)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(png)
library(readxl)

## Usage

This repository contains three main R Markdown files (`.Rmd`). Here is a brief description of each and how to use them:

1. **land_planning.Rmd**:
   - **Description**: This file is used for plotting and mapping geospatial data.
   - **Usage**: Open `land_planning.Rmd` in RStudio and click the `Knit` button to generate the HTML document. Alternatively, you can render the document from the command line:

     ```r
     rmarkdown::render("C:/ARQUIVOS COMPUTADOR/DOUTORADO/DOUTORADO TESE/03 DADOS GEOESPACIAIS/04.1 LAND PLAN/land_planning.Rmd")
     ```

Replace the file paths (`"C:/ARQUIVOS COMPUTADOR/DOUTORADO/DOUTORADO TESE/..."`) with the actual paths to the `.Rmd` files on your system. Make sure to correct any typos or extra spaces in the file names.

The files needed to run the code were larger than what GitHub allowed. Therefore, the files were made available in a folder on OneDrive:
